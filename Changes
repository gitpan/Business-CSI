     floats, not doubles. Wierd

     (pod ... or whatever).

0.21:  Tue Oct 10 08:00:29 EDT 2000
   - jettero installed a README based on another request by
     David Deppner. He pointed out that I never mention that
     you do in fact need the csi LinkPoint API installed on
     your system.

0.2:  Tue Oct 10 07:58:04 EDT 2000
   - jettero made 4 changes based on suggestions by "David
     Deppner" <dave@psyber.com>.  Apparently, the
     cc_order_set() functions are supposed to take doubles
     even though the sample app uses floats.  They are in
     fact (void *)s in the cc_api_client.h.  That suggests
     that they type cast them any way; but I did make the
     change since it was causing him trouble.  Thanks a lot
     David!
