This is actually just a wrapper for the LinkPoint API.  You
will need to d/l that and install it first.  The Makefile.PL
contains these lines:

    my $csi     = "/usr/local/csi";
    my $csi_inc = "$csi/src";
    my $csi_lib = "$csi/lib";

The simplest way to install Business::CSI is to simply put
the LinkPoint API /usr/local/csi.  Then you can use 'perl
-MCPAN -e 'install Business::CSI' without haveing to edit
the Makefile.PL.

I briefly considered doing an auto search for it, but it
would have been a total hack.  It may not have worked 100%
correctly on all systems.  It could therefore distroy the
universe.  So I elected not to.

Someone recently asked my why I didn't use
Business::OnlinePayment.  I didn't feel like the extreemly
simple interface I had in mind was completely compatable
with Bu::OnPa.  Maybe later I will go back and use it.  For
now, this package is simple to the point of being single
minded.
